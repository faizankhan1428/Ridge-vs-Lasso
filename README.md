# ML Exercise 7 - Ridge vs Lasso | Regularization Comparison

This notebook compares **Ridge** and **Lasso** regression using synthetic data to demonstrate how they impact model coefficients and error.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:
- Generate synthetic dataset with irrelevant features
- Train and evaluate Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regressions
- Visualize coefficient shrinkage and MSE

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
Understand how L1 and L2 regularization work and when to use them:
- Ridge = shrink all
- Lasso = eliminate some

### 🚀 Extensions:
- Vary alpha values and observe changes
- Use real-world datasets (e.g., diabetes)
- Plot coefficient paths with cross-validation
